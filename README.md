# Data-Transformation
This is a collection of past projects in which I use R to take raw data and transform it into a usable and readable format.

Use the links below to see an html notebook of the project.


Partisan Dehumanization (Restructuring and merging data from a complex (3x2x2) survey experiment:

In this project I am interested in seeing how dehumanization affects political attitudes and how to best prime dehumanization in a survey experiment. The data in the survey is very 'scattered' due to the 3x2x2 design. This project showcases how I merge and combine data into a readable and ready-to-analyze form.



Political Ambition (Dealing with missing values and transforming data to indices or 'batteries')
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gcm1991/Data-Transformation/blob/main/Cleaning%20Political%20Ambition.nb.html

In this project I am interested in how personality traits interact with gender to affect political ambition. Many of the respondents were not careful when filling out the survey and thus I have a lot of missing data. This data cleaning showcases how I identify missing values, and deal with them through either imputation or ommission.
